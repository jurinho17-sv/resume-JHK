    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Hi, I'm Ju Ho Kim.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page.</p>
    
    <p>I'm an aspiring software developer based in Pasadena, California, currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at Pasadena City College. My journey in tech began during my military service in South Korea, which motivated me to come to the United States. I was deeply inspired by California's reputation as a global hub of innovation, particularly in technology.</p>
    
    <p>I believe software developers have a unique ability to solve existing challenges and prevent future problems. My ultimate goal is to work in Silicon Valley alongside industry-leading engineers. While I know I have much to learn and improve, I'm proud of the significant steps I've taken so far. My optimistic mindset drives me to believe that I can achieve my goals, leveraging the experiences that have shaped my path.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for your interest in my professional journey. I hope you have a fantastic day!</p>
    
    <p>Best regards,<br>
    Ju Ho Kim</p>
